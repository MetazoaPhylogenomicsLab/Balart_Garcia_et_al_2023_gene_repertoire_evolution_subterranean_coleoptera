Source_data_1: Data of the phylogenetic tree obtained with MCMCtree (Fig.1a) and the graphic representation (bar plot and pie charts) of the significantly expanded and contracted OGs based on BadiRate results (Fig.1b).
Source_data_2: Data of the ancestral reconstruction of gene/gene family evolutionary events (i.e. gain and loss / expansion and contraction) based on the interpretation of the results of BadiRate and duplications based on Orthofinder results (Fig.2a). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment results of the ancestral gene family evolutionary events represented with Treemaps using REVIGO (Fig.2b). Orthogroup (OG) lists to construct venn diagrams (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/), representing the expanded/contracted/gained/lost gene families in parallel across the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the three beetle tribes (Fig.2c) and GO enrichment result of the contracted OGs in parallel.
Source_data_3: Orthogroup (OG) lists to construct venn diagrams (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/), representing the expanded/contracted orthogroups (OGs) in parallel across the 6 lineages that independently colonized underground habitats (Fig.3a and 3b) and Gene Ontology reduced annotation for each OG used for the alluvial plot (Fig.3c) (https://www.rawgraphs.io).
Source_data_4: Lineage specific gene gene family expansions and contractions computed in constellatoR (https://github.com/MetazoaPhylogenomicsLab/constellatoR) in order to build a similarity matrix based on their gene ontology annotations followed by a clustering method to detect functional clusters. Custom R scripts to generate heatmaps (Fig.4a) and scatter plots (Fig.4b).
Source_data_5: Expanded and contracted orthogroups (OGs) in the highly modified lineages of the tribe Leptodirini represented in a venn diagram (Fig.5a). Results of the significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms of the contracted gene families in parallel (Fig.5b)
